# Recipes Project
## Описание
An urge to cook something special is too hard to resist sometimes. But what if you lost the recipe? Or your beloved grandma is too busy to answer a call and remind you of your favorite cake recipe? Let's make a program that stores all recipes in one place. Create a multi-user web service with Spring Boot that allows storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes.
